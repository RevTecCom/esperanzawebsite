		<h3>Legalism: Useless in the face of the only "theft" that matters</h3>
        Communism is against
        copyright, it is against the pride of the individual
        artisan, it is against both the attitude of petty-bourgeois
        idealogues and the defenders of large commodity capital
        towards copyright.<br><br>
        There is a rampant disease in the discourse
        around technology, with everyone trying to find the
        "perfect license" for their work, so that they avoid
        getting "scammed" by a large conglomerate. Some also
        approach it with the disgusting prideful attitude of
        hampering creative iteration, a petty-bourgeois attitude,
        akin to a chef who relies on a "secret recipe".<br><br> 
        We have no compassion towards the latter concerns, and
        see only futility in the former concerns. The legal
        department of a large conglomerate can get away with
        essentially anything. If they want to take something,
        they will. Capitalism must necessarily turn private
        labor into social labor for the purpose of increasing
        profits, this is one of its primary objectives, and
        it will bend its own "rights" to achieve them.
