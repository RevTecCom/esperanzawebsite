        <h3>Questions & Answers - Esperanza Issue No. 1</h3>
        We have received numerous criticisms from those who have read our text,
        and so, we will address them in this page, in a Q/A format.<br><br>

        <b>Question: By distributing the issue in PDF format, aren't you
        opening up your users to vulnerabilities within PDF readers?</b><br>
        <b>Answer:</b> It's true, 
        many PDF readers are well-known to contain vulnerabilities, 
        and those who open PDFs open themselves to an exploit, in the
        same way that someone opens up others to malware via the sharing of
        an audio or video file. This question is especially valid, as
        2023 has been a particularly bountiful year for exploits
        targeting Adobe Acrobat, the most popular PDF reader.<br><br>
        However, the most likely vector for an attack would have been
        for us to have
        exploited a vulnerability in bad faith, which we have not done,
        do not have the necessary knowledge to do,
        and will never do. The other vector would have been for someone to
        exploit LibreOffice's PDF exporter, for a background process to
        have adulterated the file in the time between the export
        and the upload, for GitHub to have adulterated
        the file, or for an ISP to have adulterated it (in case of HTTP
        connections). A wide library of possibilities, none of them likely
        except for the last one.<br><br>
        This user suggests we should have uploaded a plain-text version
        of the text as a way to prevent vulnerabilities related to PDF
        readers from being exploited. However, this is a scenario where
        the format is of little importance. 
        <a href="https://threatpost.com/researcher-exploits-microsofts-notepad-to-pop-a-shell/145242/">
        Microsoft Notepad has seen a
        remote code execution exploit.</a>
         Notepad++, another popular text editor,
        <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/v857-released-fix-security-issues/">
        has seen many vulnerabilities.
        </a>
         This stuff is just part of the
        risk inherent to using software.<br><br>
        We do agree on the fact that a plain-text version would be nice,
        however, and we will provide one soon (re-formatting the spreadsheets
        is particularly annoying). To say that providing one would mitigate
        security risks in the real world is misleading.<br><br>

        <b>Question: Have you not understated the dangers of an endpoint being
        compromised? You seem to be pushing encryption as a panacea.</b><br>
        <b>Answer:</b> We understand that we may have made it unclear that
        encryption is worthless if a side of the communication is compromised.
        This is indeed an oversight in the text. We had jumped to the 
        incorrect conclusion that this may have been self-evident, which is why we 
        left it out. We do not believe we are pushing encryption as a panacea, as we 
        outlined specific use-cases instead of sticking to broad suggestions.<br><br>

        <b>Question: Why have you not addressed specific targeted attacks that
        are known to affect dissidents, such as keylogging, logging clipboard
        contents, et. cetera?</b><br>
        <b>Answer:</b> The article is a primer, and so does not deal with
        common targeted attacks. A previous draft of the text mentioned that
        it is not meant to protect against active (non-targeted) surveillance,
        merely against
        data theft (specifically theft of physical devices) and passive surveillance
        techniques. We now realize that leaving this clarification out of the final text
        was a mistake. Protection against targeted measures at an organizational level
        requires a much more sophisticated setup.

        <h3>Final Errata and Conclusion</h3>
        We have left out the important notice that the compromise of an endpoint turns
        encryption pointless. Furthermore, we have left out the necessary clarification
        to indicate that our text is merely a primer, 
        where the parts that deal with security focus mainly on the prevention of data
        theft and communications.<br><br>
        We must also bring forth an important piece of self-criticism. It is our belief
        that the audience for the text was made unclear in general. The original intent
        was to not make the text boring, but this ended up making it quite a disconnected
        ordeal. Future issues of Esperanza will be smaller and focus on specifics rather than
        the broad strokes. We will also further enhance the political aim of our texts,
        pondering on issues rather than merely writing manuals.
